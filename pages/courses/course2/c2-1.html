      <h1>What Are Variables in Programming?</h1>
      <section>
        <p>
          In programming, variables are used to store data that a program can
          manipulate. Think of a variable as a labeled container that holds a
          value. You can name the container anything meaningful, and the value
          it holds can be changed or used throughout the program.
        </p>
        <h2>Key Characteristics of Variables:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Storage for Data:</strong> Variables store information such
            as numbers, text, or even more complex data like lists.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Reusable:</strong> Once a variable is created, you can reuse
            it by referring to its name.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Dynamic:</strong> Depending on the programming language, the
            value of a variable can be updated during the program's execution.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Typed or Untyped:</strong> Some languages require you to
            specify what type of data the variable will store (e.g., integer,
            string), while others do not.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Example:</h2>
        <pre>
<code>In Python:
age = 25  # 'age' is a variable holding the number 25
name = "Alice"  # 'name' is a variable holding the text "Alice"
</code>
      </pre>
